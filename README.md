# Geological Time Scale Calculator

## Overview

This project is a simple web-based geological time scale calculator. It allows users to convert between geological eras and numerical values (years in millions). The calculator is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Users can select input type (era or years) and input corresponding values.
- Conversion logic for both era to years and years to era.
- Displays the time range for the selected era.
- Displays an image related to the selected geological era.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the HTML elements.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for the geological time scale calculator.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Select the input type: "Era" or "Years (in millions)."
3. If "Era" is selected, choose the geological era from the dropdown.
4. If "Years" is selected, enter the number of years in the input field.
5. Click the "Calculate" button to see the result.
6. The result will display the time range for the selected era and an image representing that era.

## Images
